# Mini site base

## About

A super lightweight code base to create a single page website. Pretty useful to build a small web-based tool.

Web files are stored in `/docs`, so you can easily also enable GitHub Sites for the repo to make the tool available at `https://<yourUserName>.github.io/<repoName>`
